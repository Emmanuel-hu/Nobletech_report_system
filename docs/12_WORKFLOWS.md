## Phase 2J.1 Workflow Completion

- Topic workflow: create, update, reorder, and delete topic entries within editable lifecycle states; week-number overlap is allowed and no fixed week cap is enforced.
- Concept workflow: search approved master concepts, link to topics, create and maintain adapted operational concepts, manage mapping metadata, and reorder mappings.
- Project workflow: create, update, delete draft projects, link or unlink multiple topics, and preserve unit-level ownership with explicit mapping tables.
- Project implementation workflow: create, update, delete, and reorder implementation variants with instructional and safety metadata.
- Learning outcome workflow: create operational outcomes, optional master linkage, topic/project mapping management, and duplicate-mapping prevention.
- Resource workflow: create, update, delete, and maintain metadata links for internal references and external URLs without file upload or launch behavior.
- Visibility workflow: full toggle coverage with optimistic concurrency token validation.
- Conflict workflow: version conflicts display explicit user-facing conflict state and require reload before retry.

## Phase 2K.2 Workflow Completion

- Master-content dashboard workflow: open admin area -> load entity and lifecycle counts -> navigate to entity or review queue actions.
- Entity administration workflow: list -> search or filter -> paginate -> inspect detail -> create draft or edit mutable record.
- Lifecycle workflow: submit-review -> request-revision or approve -> archive when authorized; approval is distinct from edit operations.
- Revision workflow: immutable approved or archived content requires explicit new revision creation before further edits.
- Mapping workflow: create or remove typed mappings in editable lifecycle states; duplicate and cross-tenant writes are rejected.
- Lineage workflow: create or update or remove source lineage with source metadata while enforcing ownership and lifecycle restrictions.
- Audit workflow: privileged mutations write audit entries retrievable from entity-level audit endpoints.
- Deferred boundary retained: AI extraction, OCR, upload-based ingestion, and AI-assisted generation workflows are not part of Phase 2K.2.

## Phase 2L Workflow Completion

- Source-file upload workflow: select source -> choose file -> validate extension and MIME -> store file -> register metadata row -> refresh source aggregate.
- Source-file replacement workflow: choose existing file -> upload replacement -> archive superseded file -> register replacement as active primary when applicable.
- Source-file ordering workflow: list active/archived files -> move up/down -> persist ordered file identifiers with optimistic concurrency token.
- Source-file read workflow: request download or preview -> verify tenant scope, upload status, and scan-read eligibility -> stream content from provider.
- Source-file retention workflow: archive/delete for logical lifecycle control -> unlink from source when needed -> purge only for physical provider deletion with privileged access.
- Deferred boundary retained: OCR, AI extraction, and automated content parsing are not part of Phase 2L.

## Phase 2J Workflow Additions

- Editor lookup workflow: on entry, load curriculum-scoped sessions, terms, classes, components, teachers, published versions, and approved master-library references.
- Assignment workflow hardening: select published version -> select session -> filter term choices -> validate date range -> create assignment.
- Version maintenance workflow: review version history metadata -> open snapshot preview -> create next draft from approved or published baseline.
- Structure maintenance workflow now supports explicit edit or unlink actions for concept mappings and topic/project or outcome links.
- Project delivery workflow now supports implementation variant creation, update, and draft-safe removal.

## Phase 2I Workflow Additions

- Administrative navigation flow: `Admin Dashboard -> Curriculum List -> Detail/Edit/Review/Versions/Assignments/Archive`.
- Metadata authoring flow: create curriculum -> edit metadata -> save draft with unsaved-change protection.
- Structure flow: unit creation and unit reorder foundation with topic and project visibility context.
- Review flow: submit for review -> request revision or approve -> publish approved version.
- Version flow: list stored versions -> choose left and right snapshots -> compare payloads.
- Assignment flow: create assignment scoped by version, session, term, class, and programme component -> activate/suspend/complete/archive.
- Archive flow: permission-gated archive action requiring explicit rationale.
- Deferred boundary: no AI generation/regeneration workflow is present in this phase.

## Phase 2G Workflow Additions

- Lifecycle flow: `GENERATED_DRAFT`/`DRAFT` -> `UNDER_REVIEW` -> `APPROVED` -> `PUBLISHED` -> `ARCHIVED`.
- Review and status transitions are persisted in `curriculum_review_actions` and `curriculum_status_history`.
- Publication requires approved metadata and immutable version snapshot metadata.
- Assignment flow uses immutable version references: each assignment stores `curriculum_id` + `curriculum_version_id` and academic scope fields (`session`, `term`, `class`, `school_programme_component`).

# Curriculum Governance Workflow

Generated content cannot be published directly.

Approval and publication are separate workflow actions.

Published curricula are immutable.

Any correction after publication requires creating a new DRAFT version from the published baseline.

Every status transition must write an audit trail entry with actor, timestamp, tenant, and change summary.

## Phase 2H Update: Curriculum Authoring Workflow

1. Author creates draft curriculum in school scope.
2. Author edits curriculum structure (units, topics, concepts, projects, outcomes, resources).
3. Author snapshots/version-controls draft for review readiness.
4. Reviewer executes explicit review actions (request revision or approve).
5. Publisher executes publish action after approval checks.
6. Assignment owner assigns published version and manages explicit assignment lifecycle actions.
